  "summary": "Diff updates global theme tokens to OKLCH channel values and Tailwind color mappings, and adds global Radix/Shadcn overlay CSS to force opaque backgrounds, readable foreground colors, borders, shadows, and higher z-index. Header z-index is reduced (z-40) to help overlays stack above sticky header.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Dropdowns/Select menus are not clipped by containers and remain usable on small mobile screens.",
      "reason": "The diff clearly addresses stacking (z-index) but does not clearly show (in the provided/truncated snippets) any specific global rules for max-height/overflow/viewport collision handling that would prevent clipping on small screens.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css (truncated)",

      "description": "Global styling added for Dialog/Modal and Sheet overlay surfaces (background/border/shadow/z-index).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest scope explicitly calls out dropdown-style overlays (DropdownMenu, Select, Popover, ContextMenu, Tooltip). Dialog/Sheet are not mentioned in REQ-1, and the diff adds explicit theming for them.",
